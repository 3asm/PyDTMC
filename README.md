# PyDTMC

PyDTMC is a lightweight, full-featured library for discrete-time Markov chains analysis. It provides classes and functions for easily creating, manipulating, plotting, fitting and simulating markovian stochastic processes-

## Requirements

PyDTMC only supports `Python 3` and the minimum version required is `3.6`. In addition, the environment must include the following libraries:

* [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
* [NetworkX](https://networkx.github.io/)
* [Numpy](https://www.numpy.org/)

In order to use the `plot_graph` function, [Graphviz](https://www.graphviz.org/) and [PyDot](https://pypi.org/project/pydot/) must be installed too.

## Usage

1. Create a properly structured database (see the paragraph below).
1. Edit the `run.m` script following your needs.
1. Execute the `run.m` script.
